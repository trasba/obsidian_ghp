## use cases
### hosting static website with oauth2 iam
Using AWS (Cognito/Cloudfront/S3/Lambda@Edge)
auth flow is an issue, can't happen in cloudfront (auth header could be cached) therefore lambda necessary
* tried out #[authorization @ edge](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/authorizationedge-how-to-use-lambdaedge-and-json-web-tokens-to-enhance-web-application-security/) pitfall jwt is delivered in url (auth not persistant)
* [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67031155/aws-static-website-cloudfront-signed-cookies) answer is based on [aws seting signed cookies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-setting-signed-cookie-custom-policy.html)
[AWS Authorization@Edge using cookies](https://aws.amazon.com/de/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/authorizationedge-using-cookies-protect-your-amazon-cloudfront-content-from-being-downloaded-by-unauthenticated-users/)
[Deploy from AWS Repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home?region=us-east-1#/create/app?applicationId=arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-1:520945424137:applications/cloudfront-authorization-at-edge)
## conclusion
There is no one fits all approach.
For (small) static sites a statically generated page seems the best way to go, preferably "serverless".
If the Page shall have additional functionallity static might not be the way to go.
